**Introduction**
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. Linear SVM is a type of SVM that uses a linear kernel to classify data that is linearly separable. This project demonstrates how to implement Linear SVM in Python, covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Requirements**
Python 3.6 or higher
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for visualization)

**Dataset**
This repository includes an example dataset from SciKit-Learn module called Iris dataset. You can replace this with your own dataset by following the suitable format.

**Evaluation**
The performance of the Linear SVM model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The classification_report from scikit-learn provides a detailed breakdown of these metrics.

**Results**
Results of the model evaluation, including accuracy and detailed classification metrics, will be printed in the console. Visualizations of the decision boundaries and other relevant plots can be found in the notebooks directory.

**Contributing**
Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss any changes or improvements.
